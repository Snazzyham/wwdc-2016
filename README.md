# WWDC - 2016

This is a syntax theme for Sublime, and now Vim. ~~I plan to be adding support for Atom in the coming days.~~ I have now added an Atom theme as well, which can be installed by copying the `wwwdc-2016-atom` folder and placing it in your atom dotfile directory `~/.atom/packages/`.  

I've also added another syntax for Vi that swaps out the sharp red colour for a lighter pink, for people who find the red too harsh.   

It is based off the WWDC 2016 marketing and stuff colour scheme. 

I designed a [replacement icon for sublime](https://dribbble.com/shots/2778110-Sublime-Text-Replacement-Icon-WWDC-2016-Edition) based off the same theme.  

*Special thanks to [this codepen](http://codepen.io/macx/pen/PNaQvX/) for all the colours.*  

It works best with a nice mono typeface, personally I'm excited to give SF Mono a shot, but till then, Roboto Mono it is.
